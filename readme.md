🎨 Customization
Video Templates
Modify video generation in backend/src/services/videoGenerator.js:

javascript
// Customize text positioning
getTextPosition(sceneType) {
  switch (sceneType) {
    case 'hook': return 'x=(w-text_w)/2:y=h*0.8';
    case 'cta': return 'x=(w-text_w)/2:y=h*0.1';
    // Add your positions
  }
}

// Customize font sizes
getFontSize(sceneType) {
  switch (sceneType) {
    case 'hook': return 72;
    case 'cta': return 64;
    // Add your sizes
  }
}
AI Prompts
Customize script generation in backend/src/services/aiGenerator.js:

javascript
createScriptPrompt(productData) {
  return `
    Create a compelling ${this.duration}-second video ad for:
    Product: ${productData.title}
    
    Style: ${this.style} // Add custom styles
    Target: ${this.audience} // Add target audience
    // Customize your prompts
  `;
}
🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
LM Studio Connection Failed

bash
# Check if LM Studio server is running
curl http://localhost:1234/health

# Common solutions:
# 1. Make sure LM Studio is open and server is started
# 2. Check if model is loaded in LM Studio
# 3. Verify port 1234 is not blocked by firewall
# 4. Try restarting LM Studio server
Model Loading Issues

Ensure you have sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended)
Try a smaller model if experiencing memory issues
Check LM Studio logs for specific error messages
FFmpeg not found

bash
# Check if FFmpeg is installed
ffmpeg -version

# Install if missing (see Prerequisites)
Scraping fails

Some sites block automated scraping
Try different product URLs
Check network connectivity
Video generation slow

Video generation can take 1-3 minutes
LM Studio performance depends on your hardware
Ensure sufficient disk space
Check CPU/memory usage
Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging:

bash
DEBUG=* npm run dev
LM Studio Performance Tips
Model Selection
Smaller models (3B parameters) = faster but less creative
Larger models (8B+ parameters) = better quality but slower
Hardware Optimization
Use GPU acceleration if available
Allocate more RAM to LM Studio
Close unnecessary applications
Model Settings
Lower temperature for more consistent outputs
Reduce max tokens if responses are too long
Adjust context length based on your needs
